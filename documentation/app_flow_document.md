# App Flow Document for Encanta

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

Users first encounter Encanta through the engaging public-facing marketing website that clearly presents two distinct pathways: one for the DIY self-service platform and another for consulting services. A new visitor is greeted with interactive demos, clear value propositions, and vivid calls-to-action that invite them to either start generating content with ease or schedule a consultation with an expert. Users who decide to move forward with the self-service approach click on a prominent "Get Started" button, while those seeking high-touch consulting complete a lead capture form with detailed business information before being directed to a specialized sign-up process.

After selecting their preferred path, the registration process begins. The sign-up process is built on a secure authentication system provided by Clerk. Users can register using their email address or choose social login methods if available. Guided instructions help them complete the registration form quickly. Once registered, an interactive onboarding walkthrough is presented. This walkthrough explains key features such as creating workspaces, configuring brand profiles, and navigating the AI-driven content generation tools. In case users forget their password, a clear “Forgot Password” option is provided that securely initiates the password recovery process. Signing out is equally straightforward, always accessible in the header or via a simple account dropdown on the dashboard.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Once logged in, users land on an intuitive and well-organized SaaS dashboard that serves as the central hub for managing all their projects. The dashboard is clean with a consistent design that matches the overall branding of Encanta. Users see a top header with vital account information, a sidebar that neatly categorizes key sections such as workspaces, content generation tools, and collaboration areas, and central widgets that display recent activity and upcoming tasks. The dashboard is designed to provide immediate visual feedback on AI task statuses, and key call-to-action buttons are prominently displayed to start new content projects or to interact with files and team members. Navigation between workspaces, team collaboration areas, and the AI content generation system is intuitive, ensuring that non-technical users can easily move from one section to another without confusion.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

After completing onboarding, users are guided into the core functionalities of the Encanta platform. In the workspaces section, each user can create and manage multiple workspaces representing different brands or projects. The process begins with a simple setup wizard that guides users through naming the workspace, uploading necessary brand assets like logos, and selecting a color palette and typography that align with their visual identity. Once a workspace is set up, users have access to a dedicated area to manage their team collaboration. Here, they can invite team members, assign roles with specific permissions, and start sharing documents for real-time collaborative editing.

For content generation, users enter a dynamic interface where the modular AI agent system is fully integrated. They select from multiple AI-powered workflows ranging from ideation and research to drafting and editing. The interface is designed to provide live visual feedback as the AI processes tasks; progress bars and notifications clearly indicate when content is ready for review. Users can interact with content directly, leaving comments, making edits, and accessing document version histories to revert to earlier iterations if necessary. Advanced users can also configure and test brand profile settings in real-time, watching as the AI adjusts its tone and style to match the provided guidelines through a live preview panel.

Users with a premium subscription or engaged in consulting services have access to a dedicated payment and subscription management flow. These users are guided through a Stripe-integrated payment flow that supports recurring billing, trial periods, and secure checkout. Once payment is successfully processed, the enhanced features and expert consultation options are activated, and users receive personalized recommendations through the dashboard. Transitioning from a self-service journey to a consulting engagement is designed to be seamless. For example, a user in the dashboard can easily switch from using pre-built templates and demo content to accessing the client scheduling tool and lead capture forms provided on the consulting service pages.

## Settings and Account Management

Within the dashboard, the settings area empowers users to manage every aspect of their account and customize the platform according to their needs. This section includes options to update personal details, change passwords, and configure email notifications or other alerts about activity in workspaces. Users can also tweak brand customization settings, such as uploading new logos, selecting custom color schemes, and modifying typography. The brand profile configuration is directly tied to workspaces, ensuring that all content generated adheres to the specified visual and tonal guidelines. For those on premium plans, a dedicated billing management interface allows them to view and update subscription details, access invoices, and modify payment methods through the Stripe-integrated customer portal. Once adjustments are saved, the settings update is reflected across the platform, and users are returned to the main dashboard seamlessly.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

The Encanta platform is built to handle errors gracefully and provide users with clear instructions on how to correct issues. If users input invalid data during sign-up, workspace creation, or brand profile configuration, the system immediately highlights the problematic field with helpful messages and suggestions for correction. Loss of connectivity does not break the workflow; users are informed of temporary network issues through unobtrusive notifications and given the option to retry automatically. When users attempt actions that require elevated permissions (for example, editing content without proper role-based access), the system alerts them and suggests ways to request the necessary permissions. In cases where AI tasks encounter issues, fallback mechanisms are triggered automatically. If automated quality checks fail to meet predefined thresholds, the system either reprocesses the request with adjusted parameters or flags the content for additional human review. These error states are designed so that users can quickly recover and resume their work without feeling lost or overwhelmed.
