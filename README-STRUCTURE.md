# README Structure Explanation

This project contains two README.md files:

1. `/README.md` (Root README): 
   - Located at the root of the repository
   - Contains comprehensive project documentation
   - Includes detailed information about the project structure, features, tech stack, and setup instructions
   - Serves as the main documentation for developers and contributors
   - Includes storage naming conventions and other technical details

2. `/encanta/README.md` (Monorepo README):
   - Located inside the monorepo directory
   - Contains information specific to the monorepo structure
   - Includes details about the marketing section, authentication pages, and image requirements
   - Serves as a quick reference for developers working within the monorepo
   - Contains placeholder links and other development-specific information

## Why Two README Files?

The dual README structure serves different purposes:

1. **Repository-Level Documentation**: The root README provides a comprehensive overview of the entire project, making it easier for new developers to understand the project as a whole.

2. **Monorepo-Specific Documentation**: The monorepo README focuses on details specific to the monorepo structure, making it easier for developers working within the monorepo to find relevant information.

## CHANGELOG Structure

Similarly, we maintain two CHANGELOG.md files:

1. `/CHANGELOG.md` (Root CHANGELOG):
   - Contains a comprehensive history of all changes to the project
   - Includes version numbers and dates for major releases
   - Organized by version with Added, Changed, and Fixed sections

2. `/encanta/CHANGELOG.md` (Monorepo CHANGELOG):
   - Contains changes specific to the monorepo
   - May include more detailed information about changes to specific packages or applications

## Best Practices

When updating documentation:

1. **Keep Both READMEs in Sync**: Ensure that important information is reflected in both README files as appropriate.

2. **Update CHANGELOGs with Each Release**: Add entries to both CHANGELOG files when making significant changes, including a timestamp for better tracking.

3. **Use Version Numbers**: Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for releases and reflect these in the CHANGELOG files.

4. **Include Dates**: Add dates to CHANGELOG entries to provide a clear timeline of changes.
